OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING

DESCRIPTION:
This project focus on Object-relational Mapping in Python,
     combining python programming with database interaction using
     SQL and ORM tools. It;
     1. Connects Python programs to MySQL databases.
     2. Use SQLAlchemy for database management.
     3. Transition between traditional SQL queries and ORM techniques.
